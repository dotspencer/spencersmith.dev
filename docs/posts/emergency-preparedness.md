The rule of thumb is 1 gallon per person per day. With these 7 gal containers the math is easy since each container will last one person for one week. We're working toward storing 5 weeks worth of water, which for our family of four turns out to 20 containers.

On the Amazon page make sure to select the "11.3 Inch x 11.0 Inch x 15.3 Inch" size, which should be around $15. There's another size listed but it's actually the same product just at a higher price from a third-party seller.

Another thing to note is that Amazon won't let you order more than 4 of them at a time. After around a month or so it let us put in a second order so getting the number you'd want may take some time. If you didn't want to wait you can also find them at REI, they're just a little more expensive.

Some reviewers mentioned that the spigot leaked but they solved the issue by adding an o-ring. It's really only an issue when it's tipped on it's side and doesn't affect long term storage upright. But to be safe we purchased some and have used them from the beginning and haven't had any leaks. We used Danco #17 O-Rings which came in a 10 pack. It's a cheap fix and definitely worth it in my mind. You can pick it up at Home Depot in the plumbing section or on Amazon (https://amzn.to/3rDkNvx) for the same price.

Last note is that they can't be stacked when full of water because they will crush the lower ones from the weight. So if you have more than a few and you want to minimize the space they take up, you'll need to store them on a shelf.

**Solar Power Station - https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u**

This power station comes in different configurations from 160Wh up to 1000Wh, all of which run around $1 per Wh. We decided on the 240Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u) because it was on the less expensive end but still seemed like it'd be enough for our needs. If you're looking for something more powerful, a good upgrade would be the 500Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WOIClC).

I liked the Jackery brand power stations because they have a simple and durable design, include MPPT (faster solar charging), and include an input watt meter so you can tell how your solar panels are performing at any time.

Jackery sells solar panels for their power stations but I decided on Rockpals because folded up smaller, had better water resistance, and were actually cheaper. The main two I was deciding between were the 60w (https://amzn.to/2WQ3vwK) and the 100w (https://amzn.to/3aLXNV4). I decided on the 60w because I liked the price point better ($100 vs $190) and it seemed like it would be good enough for us. But if you want to charge up your power station in as little time as possible, the 100w could be the better option for you.
