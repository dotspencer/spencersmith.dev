# Family Camping / Emergency Preparedness List (2021)

## Water

**Water Storage Containers - https://amzn.to/3aIIFrt**

The rule of thumb is 1 gallon per person per day. With these 7 gal containers the math is easy since each container will last one person for one week. We're working toward storing 5 weeks worth of water, which for our family of four turns out to 20 containers.

On the Amazon page make sure to select the "11.3 Inch x 11.0 Inch x 15.3 Inch" size, which should be around $15. There's another size listed but it's actually the same product just at a higher price from a third-party seller.

Another thing to note is that Amazon won't let you order more than 4 of them at a time. After around a month or so it let us put in a second order so getting the number you'd want may take some time. If you didn't want to wait you can also find them at REI, they're just a little more expensive.

Some reviewers mentioned that the spigot leaked but they solved the issue by adding an o-ring. I can only imagine it being an issue when it's tipped on it's side and wouldn't affect long term storage upright. But to be safe we purchased some and have used them from the beginning and haven't had any leaks. We used Danco #17 O-Rings which came in a 10 pack. It's a cheap fix and definitely worth it in my mind. You can pick it up at Home Depot in the plumbing section or on Amazon (https://amzn.to/3rDkNvx) for the same price.

Last note is that they can't be stacked when full of water because they will crush the lower ones from the weight. So you'll need to store them on a shelf if you have more than a few and you want to minimize the space they take up.

**Water Filters - https://amzn.to/38GD8ie**

We've used these multiple times backpacking and they're super nice because you don't have to worry about all the parts of traditional pump style filters. They're simple, lightweight, and just work.

## Shelter, Warmth

**10x14 Canvas Tent - https://www.competitiveedgeproducts.com/Kodiak-Canvas-10x14-ft-6014-8-person-Deluxe-Canvas-Tent_p_18.html**

**Portable Propane Heater - https://www.lowes.com/pd/h/3353726**

[<img src="https://mobileimages.lowes.com/product/converted/089301/089301320208.jpg?size=pdhi" height="200">](https://www.lowes.com/pd/h/3353726)

**Adapter Hose (20lb to 1lb) - https://www.lowes.com/pd/h/1121689**

**Propane Hose Filter - https://www.lowes.com/pd/h/3029755**

The heater above comes with a connection for the green 1 lb camping propane tanks but with the adapter hose and filter you can use the heater with any standard 20+ lb tank. While you could use the heater and hose without the filter, the high pressure of the propane forces small amounts of oil out of the rubber in the hose. That oil can clog up the pores of the ceramic heating element and prevent it from working properly after sustained use.


## Cooking, Fire

**2 Burner Propane Stove - https://amzn.to/2MemRtH**

**4ft Adapter Hose (20lb to 1lb) - https://www.homedepot.com/p/4-ft-Hose-with-Adaptor-711-0004/206338534**

Allows using 20+ lb tanks instead of the normal green 1 lb camping tanks for extended use. Works the same as the adapter hose for the heater but does not need to be used with a filter since the oil from the rubber can be burned off without any issues.


## Light, Electricity, Communications

**Solar Power Station - https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u**

[<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FtElwWrBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" height="200">](https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u)

This power station comes in different configurations from 160Wh up to 1000Wh, all of which run around $1 per Wh. We decided on the 240Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u) because it was on the less expensive end but still seemed like it'd be enough for our needs. If you're looking for something more powerful, a good upgrade would be the 500Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WOIClC).

I liked the Jackery brand power stations because they have a simple and durable design, include MPPT (faster solar charging), and include an input watt meter so you can tell how your solar panels are performing at any time.

Jackery sells solar panels for their power stations but I decided on Rockpals because they folded up smaller, were water resistant, and were actually cheaper. The main two I was deciding between were the 60w (https://amzn.to/2WQ3vwK) and the 100w (https://amzn.to/3aLXNV4). I decided on the 60w because I liked the price point ($100 vs $190) and it seemed like it would be good enough for us. But if you want to charge up your power station in as little time as possible, the 100w could be the better option for you.

**900 Lumen Rechargeable Flashlight - https://amzn.to/2MbKGlL**

We're starting to transition from disposable battery (AA/AAA) powered things to rechargeable so that they could be recharged from our solar panel and power station. These flashlights are water resistant, super bright, usb rechargeable, and are powered by 18650 batteries that can be replaced if need be.

We also have the smaller 400 lumen version (https://amzn.to/38GVbov) and it has worked great as well.

**Rechargeable Camping Lantern - https://amzn.to/39ecA8w**

This light is a great hanging lantern for inside the tent but also doubles as a 3000mAh power bank that can be used to recharge other electronics. It also has a magnetic base so it can be stuck to your fridge for light in an emergency. The flood light lasts for 5 hours on high brightness and 11 hours on medium brightness.
