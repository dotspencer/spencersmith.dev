The rule of thumb is <strong>1 gallon per person per day</strong>. With these containers the math is easy since each container will last one person for one week. We're working toward storing 5 weeks worth of water, which for our family of four turns out to 20 containers.

Some reviewers mentioned that the spigot leaked and they solved the issue by adding an o-ring. We purchased some and have used them from the beginning and have noticed zero leaks. The o-ring we used was the Danco #17 O-Ring which came in a 10 pack. You can pick it up from Home Depot or on Amazon (https://amzn.to/3rDkNvx)

This power station comes in different configurations from 160Wh up to 1000Wh, all of which run around $1 per Wh. We decided on the 240Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WNfZ8u) because it was on the less expensive end but still seemed like it'd be enough for our needs. If you're looking for something more powerful, a good upgrade would be the 500Wh version (https://amzn.to/2WOIClC).

I liked the Jackery brand power stations because they include MPPT (faster solar charging) and an input watt meter so you can tell how your solar panels are performing.

Jackery sells solar panels for their power stations but I decided on Rockpals because folded up smaller, had better water resistance, and were actually cheaper. The main two I was deciding between were the 60w (https://amzn.to/2WQ3vwK) and the 100w (https://amzn.to/3aLXNV4). I decided on the 60w because it seemed like a slightly better value for the money. But if you want to charge up your power station in as little time as possible, the 100w would be the better option.
