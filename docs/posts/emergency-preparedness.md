It's recommended to store <strong>1 gallon per person per day</strong>. With these containers the math is easy since each container will last one person for one week. Our goal is to have 5 weeks worth of water for our family of four which turns out to 20 containers.

Some reviewers mentioned that the spigot leaked and they solved the issue by adding an o-ring. We purchased some along with the containers and have used them from the start and have noticed zero leaks. The o-ring I used was the Danco #17 O-Ring which came in a 10 pack. You can pick it up from Home Depot or the same price on Amazon (https://amzn.to/3rDkNvx)
